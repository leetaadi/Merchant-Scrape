# Merchant-Scrape
The Merchant Scrape Tool is a real-time web application built with Flask and Selenium that allows users to scrape business information from Google Maps based on a keyword search, such as "bakery" or "restaurant." Users can specify the number of businesses they want to extract, and the tool will automatically collect details like business name, address, phone number, website, and the direct Google Maps URL. The scraping process is streamed live on the webpage using Server-Sent Events (SSE), providing real-time feedback as each business is processed. The tool uses Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with Google Maps, and webdriver-manager ensures hassle-free driver setup. This application is ideal for lead generation, competitor research, and market analysis, offering a user-friendly interface and a powerful scraping backend.
